## 💻 Featured Projects



### 📈 Quantitative Sparse Portfolio Optimisation for Index Replication

- Developed **sparse index tracking algorithms** using Majorisation-Minimisation and Huber penalties, improving portfolio replication accuracy over traditional methods
- Built a **Python-based backtesting framework** (pandas, NumPy) to simulate market conditions, improving risk assessment and predictive reliability
- Designed **AWS-based data pipelines** (Hadoop, Spark) to process 10TB+ of financial data, significantly improving computational efficiency
- Applied **ℓ₀- and ℓ₁-norm approximations** with surrogate functions to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency compared to direct ℓ₁-regularisation
- Developed **scalable index tracking models** using convex relaxation and mixed-integer optimisation for large asset universes
- Created **predictive models** to optimise rebalancing intervals, reducing transaction costs by ~12% while balancing tracking accuracy and liquidity constraints

## 💼 Professional Experience



### Freelance Full Stack Developer – London, UK (July 2020 – September 2022)

- Designed and deployed a **client acquisition system** using a UK business database API, identifying 1,000+ high-revenue businesses weekly
- Automated **website code scraping and technology analysis**, identifying 100+ potential clients weekly by targeting outdated frameworks
- Optimised **React components** (code splitting, lazy loading) and Node.js server-side data fetching, increasing user engagement by 40%
- Developed **secure APIs** with the MERN stack, using JWT authentication and caching to improve security and processing speed
- Delivered **bespoke website solutions** for 10+ clients with 100% retention rate through effective communication

## 🌉 Bridging Technology and Analytics



The synergy between my web development experience and data science skills allows me to offer a unique perspective on both creating impactful web solutions and deriving meaningful insights from complex datasets. This dual focus equips me with a holistic view of the technological landscape, from front-end development to back-end data processing.
