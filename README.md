## 💻 Featured Projects

### 📈 [Quantitative Sparse Portfolio Optimisation for Index Replication](https://github.com/griffin1995/portfolio-optimisation)

- Developed **sparse index tracking algorithms** using Majorisation-Minimisation and Huber penalties, improving portfolio replication accuracy over traditional methods
- Built a **Python-based backtesting framework** (pandas, NumPy) to simulate market conditions, improving risk assessment and predictive reliability
- Designed **AWS-based data pipelines** (Hadoop, Spark) to process 10TB+ of financial data, significantly improving computational efficiency
- Applied **ℓ₀- and ℓ₁-norm approximations** with surrogate functions to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency compared to direct ℓ₁-regularisation
- Developed **scalable index tracking models** using convex relaxation and mixed-integer optimisation for large asset universes
- Created **predictive models** to optimise rebalancing intervals, reducing transaction costs by ~12% while balancing tracking accuracy and liquidity constraints

**Architecture Overview:**
```
Data Ingestion → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Backtesting → Optimisation → Performance Analysis
```

### 💱 [Cryptocurrency Trading Platform](https://github.com/griffin1995/crypto-trading-platform)

- Architected a **full-stack cryptocurrency trading platform** using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
- Implemented **robust JWT-based authentication** and detailed role-based access control for secure data handling
- Developed a **real-time order matching engine** integrating third-party cryptocurrency APIs to simulate accurate price discovery
- Built a **modular backend** using Express.js and MongoDB to demonstrate secure, scalable authentication and real-time API integration
- Designed the platform architecture to handle concurrent trades and maintain data consistency

**System Architecture:**
```
Frontend (React) ↔️ API Gateway ↔️ Backend Services (Order Processing, Authentication, Data Aggregation) ↔️ Databases & External APIs
```

## 💼 Professional Experience

### Freelance Full Stack Developer – London, UK (July 2020 – September 2022)

- Designed and deployed a **client acquisition system** using a UK business database API, identifying 1,000+ high-revenue businesses weekly
- Automated **website code scraping and technology analysis**, identifying 100+ potential clients weekly by targeting outdated frameworks
- Optimised **React components** (code splitting, lazy loading) and Node.js server-side data fetching, increasing user engagement by 40%
- Developed **secure APIs** with the MERN stack, using JWT authentication and caching to improve security and processing speed
- Delivered **bespoke website solutions** for 10+ clients with 100% retention rate through effective communication

## 🔍 Current Focus

I'm currently exploring the intersection of **deep learning and quantitative finance**, with a particular focus on:

- Applying transformer architectures to time-series financial data
- Developing more efficient sparse optimisation techniques for large-scale portfolio management
- Building cloud-native data processing pipelines for financial analytics
- Researching reinforcement learning approaches to dynamic asset allocation

## 🌉 Bridging Technology and Analytics

The synergy between my software engineering expertise and data science skills allows me to offer a unique perspective on both creating robust algorithmic solutions and deriving meaningful insights from complex datasets. This dual focus equips me with a holistic view of the technological landscape, from algorithm design to distributed system implementation.
