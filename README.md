## 💻 Featured Projects

---

### 📈 Quantitative Sparse Portfolio Optimisation for Index Replication

- Developed **sparse index tracking algorithms** using Majorisation-Minimisation and Huber penalties, improving portfolio replication accuracy over traditional methods
- Built a **Python-based backtesting framework** (pandas, NumPy) to simulate market conditions, improving risk assessment and predictive reliability
- Designed **AWS-based data pipelines** (Hadoop, Spark) to process 10TB+ of financial data, significantly improving computational efficiency
- Applied **ℓ₀- and ℓ₁-norm approximations** with surrogate functions to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency compared to direct ℓ₁-regularisation
- Developed **scalable index tracking models** using convex relaxation and mixed-integer optimisation for large asset universes
- Created **predictive models** to optimise rebalancing intervals, reducing transaction costs by ~12% while balancing tracking accuracy and liquidity constraints

### 💱 Cryptocurrency Trading Platform with API Integration

- Architected a **full-stack cryptocurrency trading platform** using the MERN stack, incorporating robust JWT-based authentication
- Developed a **real-time order matching engine** integrating Binance and Coinbase APIs for accurate price discovery
- Built a **modular backend** using Express.js and MongoDB for secure, scalable authentication and API integration
- Implemented **role-based access control** to ensure secure data handling in simulated trading scenarios

## 💼 Professional Experience
